# 我与R的爱恨情仇 | My Love-Hate Relationship with R

「时间」是个抽象的名词，你看不到、摸不到，却能够在回忆中感受得到。 

"Time" is an abstract concept. You can't see or touch it, but you can feel it vividly in your memories. 

## 拿起又放下 | Picking It Up and Letting It Go

那是三年前的一天，我和大学导师坐在饭桌上聊起了关于编程的事。我依稀记得，那段时间我正在学习Python，所以就聊到了这个话题。老师说：“你是学医的，学Python还不如学点R。” 

Three years ago, my college mentor and I were having lunch and discussing programming. At the time, I was learning Python, which naturally became a topic of our conversation. My mentor suggested, “You're a medical student; instead of Python, maybe learning some R would be better.” 

那是我第一次听到R的存在，它像一个神秘的符号语言，一直牵动着我内心对编程的渴望。 

That was the first time I heard about R. It felt like a mysterious symbolic language that ignited my inner desire to learn programming. 

回到寝室后，我在网上查了相关资料，但依然不清楚R到底是什么。几天后，我前往学校图书馆，打算碰碰运气。也许是运气好，我在杂乱的书堆里翻到了一本叫《R语言数据清洗》的书。但我只是时常翻阅，没有跟着操作，这是我当时学习最大的失误。 

When I returned to my dorm, I searched online about R but still couldn't clearly understand what it was. A few days later, I visited our university library, hoping to find some luck. Perhaps it was destiny or sheer luck—I found a book titled "Data Cleaning with R" in a messy pile of books. I often flipped through its pages, but regrettably, my biggest mistake was merely reading without practicing. 

在接下来一年多的时间里，我陆续接触了不同的资源，但学习过程凌乱不堪。每次系统地学习R，只能坚持一两天便放弃，几个月后又重头再来，一直在这种反复中浪费了整整一年。

For over a year after knowing what R was, I sporadically encountered various resources. However, my learning was scattered. Each attempt to systematically study R only lasted one or two days before giving up. Weeks or even months later, I would restart from scratch, trapped in this cycle of starting and stopping. That entire year was essentially wasted. 

## 实战 | Practical Experience

到了大三，我心中想参加大学生创新创业竞赛的种子重新燃烧了起来。 

In my junior year, the desire to participate in the College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition rekindled within me. 

我再次找到了导师，并在大量阅读复杂文献后，确定了“EZH2表达对HCC患者预后的影响”这个课题。尽管经历了种种困难，我最终勉强完成了项目，遗憾的是没能发表SCI，这是我内心的遗憾。 

I consulted my mentor again and decided on a research project after extensive reading of complex literature. We finalized the topic: "The Effect of EZH2 Expression on Prognosis in HCC Patients." Despite countless challenges, I managed to complete the project, albeit without publishing an SCI paper—an unresolved regret. 

通过整个使用R分析数据的流程，我对R有了基本的了解。这种经历增强了我彻底学好R的决心。虽然曾多次徘徊在入门边缘，但最近我又迎来了新一轮的重启。 

Through the process of conducting this R-based data analysis, I gained a general understanding of R. This experience significantly strengthened my determination to master R. I hesitated repeatedly at the threshold of proficiency until recently experiencing another rebirth of enthusiasm. 

## 我要彻底成为数据科学家 | Becoming a Data Scientist Once and For All

就在几天前，我订阅了ChatGPT Plus，并决定让它成为我的R学习教练，以免浪费我的投资。 

A few days ago, I subscribed to ChatGPT Plus and designated ChatGPT as my R learning coach to ensure my investment wouldn't be wasted. 

反思过去的学习路径，我发现自己总被问题卡住无法前进，根源在于缺少一位能指导我的老师。有了ChatGPT，解决疑问变得便利许多，我的学习信心也大幅增强。 

Reflecting on my past learning journey, I realized I always got stuck on problems. The underlying issue was the lack of a mentor who could guide me. With ChatGPT, resolving queries became significantly easier, greatly boosting my learning confidence. 

在与R交锋的过程中，我真正感受到了自学的困难。这种困难让我对自学多了一些敬畏和理解。我过去以为学习目标与学习路径是线性的，但学习R让我意识到根本不是这样。 

Throughout my journey with R, I've truly understood the challenge of self-learning. Perhaps this very difficulty has taught me respect and deeper insight into self-education. I once assumed a linear relationship between goals and learning paths, but studying R proved otherwise. 

希望未来有R的日子里，我走得更加稳健和从容，对待学习也更加勇敢。 

I hope that in my future days with R, my steps will become steadier and calmer, approaching learning with greater courage.
