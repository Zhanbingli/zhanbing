最近我遇到了一个大问题。

我发现我经常在各种网页和app之间来回切换，导致我根本无法专注于做好当前的事。

比如，我会在ChatGPT和Google之间来回切换，有时甚至还要加上Kindle、Rstudio、vscode等，以至于我真正花在学习上和做事上的时间少之又少，我很害怕这种过多的选择会让我没有将一件事情做完成，而是都成为了半成品，甚至连半成品也算不上。

在没有这些之前，我唯一的选择就是得到app，在那上面阅读自己喜欢的电子书，而现在我连一本书都没有读完，感觉自己无法真正沉浸到阅读的世界中。此刻回想起来还是挺可怕的，也许我确实做了很多事，但没有一样是完整的完成，这让我无法体会到完成一件事的乐趣和满足感。我希望有人能够给我答案，我是不是想要的太多了，到最后却什么也得不到。这种预感让我有点害怕，我害怕自己终究只是一个平凡的人，不能完成自己的人生规划，不能去自己想去的地方，不能追寻心中的自由。

为什么我总是在寻找方法和决策的方案，却从未行动过，我到底是怎么了，我如何才能改变这种现状，我需要答案，更需要行动。

## English (Translation)

Recently I ran into a major problem.

I realized I often switch back and forth between various websites and apps, which makes it impossible for me to focus on doing the current task well.

For example, I keep toggling between ChatGPT and Google, and sometimes I add Kindle, RStudio, VS Code, and others into the mix. As a result, the actual time I spend learning or doing real work is very limited. I'm afraid that having too many options will prevent me from fully completing anything — everything becomes half-finished, or not even that.

Before all this, my only choice was to open an app and read the ebooks I liked. Now I haven't finished a single book; I feel unable to truly immerse myself in reading. Looking back, it’s quite scary. Maybe I have indeed done many things, but none of them was completed, so I can’t experience the joy and satisfaction of finishing something. I wish someone could tell me whether I’m asking for too much and end up getting nothing. This feeling terrifies me a little — I worry I may just be an ordinary person who can’t fulfill life plans, can’t go where I want, and can’t pursue the freedom in my heart.

Why am I always searching for methods and decisions but never taking action? What is wrong with me, and how can I change this situation? I need answers, and I need action more than answers.
